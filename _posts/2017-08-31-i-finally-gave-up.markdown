excerpt: Announced this site to the world.

After resisting for over 10 years the urging of many, including my dear former
advisor and mentor [Hector Geffner](http://www.tecn.upf.es/~hgeffner/), I have
decided to start my own website... Thanks to [Gal Kaminka](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~galk/)
who made me reconsider my former views on "home pages" being something of the past.

Stay updated as I start uploading content and ranting about various other
topics.
