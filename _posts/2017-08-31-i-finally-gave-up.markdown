title: I Finally Gave Up
---

After resisting for many years the urging of many, including my dear former
advisor and mentor [Hector Geffner](http://www.tecn.upf.es/~hgeffner/) I have
decided to start my own website... [Gal Kaminka's](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~galk/)
recent nagging tipped me over the fence of those skeptical of the future of personal
home pages.

Stay updated as I start uploading content and ranting about various other
topics.
